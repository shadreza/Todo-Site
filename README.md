1. As this is my first go with TypeScript do many things were bit troublesome in the beginning but now Alhamdulillah fairly comfortable
2. The useState and useContext ans createContext and document.getElementById these stuff were very problematic for me and they took the biggest time
3. The hooks were figured out by the help of generic type
4. The document problem was fixed by using the keyword 'as HTMLInputElement' cause then it got the point and then I could reset the value
5. The packages were somewhat different and had to add '@types/react' and others in some extents for installing the packages
6. The firebase importing was a bit issuing but it was fixed by auto import

## One Question to you...
I had set the Header component in the App and then in the Header component I did the routing using react-router-dom and after that in other pages I can easily use the useHistory hook but unable to do it in the Header component...

## If you got the answer then I would be glad to hear from you!
